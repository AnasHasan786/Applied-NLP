## **üåç Introduction**

<p align="justify">
  Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an essential subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP powers many modern AI applications, such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, text summarization, language translation, and much more. 
  This repository contains various NLP projects that aim to apply machine learning techniques to tackle practical problems, from text classification to sequence generation.

## **üîé Projects Overview**

### **üìß Spam Ham Classification**

- **Description**: In this project, we build a model to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam). This is one of the most common text classification tasks that uses NLP techniques to detect unwanted email.
- **Techniques Used**: 
  - **Bag of Words (BoW)**
  - **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**
  - **Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier**
- **Outcome**: The **TF-IDF model** achieved an impressive **92% accuracy**, outperforming the BoW model.

### **üìù Text Generation using RNN**

- **Description**: This project focuses on text generation using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). I used a dataset of merged CSV files to train an RNN model. However, due to the merging of multiple files, there may be some inconsistencies in the data, leading to suboptimal results. Future improvements will focus on refining the dataset and model.
- **Techniques Used**: 
  - **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**
  - **Tokenization**
  - **Text Preprocessing**
- **Current Status**: The model is still being fine-tuned, and improvements are ongoing to clean the data and enhance text generation quality.
